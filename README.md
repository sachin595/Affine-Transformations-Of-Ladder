# Affine-Transformations-Of-Ladder
In this exploration of affine transformations, I delved into the fascinating realm of geometric manipulations using homogeneous coordinates. Beginning with the application of perspective transformation to project a ladder onto a walkway, I seamlessly integrated various affine transformations, including rotation, translation, and reflection. The homogeneous coordinate system facilitated realistic simulations of depth and distance, offering a nuanced perspective on the ladder's appearance. The results showcased the transformative power of affine operations, and the discussion underscored their significance in computer graphics and vision. Witnessing the synergistic effects of perspective transformation, rotation, and translation was not only insightful but also deeply satisfying, affirming the efficacy of these mathematical concepts in visual simulations.
